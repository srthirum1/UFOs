# UFOs Module Analysis 

1. Overview of the analysis
This project goal was to demonstrate our knowledge by creating a html page that uses js data using filters we created. Some of these filters are based on different areas or shapes of ufos. 

2. Results
The result of this was a successful working interactive page where users can see all the data and filters we have provided. Filters include, state, country, shape, date and city. Once you enter appropriate filters based on user siting, the site will populate a result of sightings that match the filters that the user has choosen. 

3. Summary 

Overall we have created various filters for users to parse through ufo js data provided using an interactive html page, css for styling and included images as well.
